userconf lastfile var name incorrect

userconf doesn't exist => still tries to check property => still continues (set -eu failure)
  * will-consume function has: "|| true", maybe this hides the exit?

checksum fails (e.g. just some crap as expected sum) => done touched => never retries! (set -eu failure)
